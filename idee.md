# 🧠 Survive Disasters for Brainrots

**Survive Disasters for Brainrots** is a fast-paced multiplayer chaos game where players race through dangerous disaster maps to rescue rare brainrot creatures and grow their personal base.

The core gameplay combines disaster survival, competitive collecting, and base progression into a highly replayable loop designed for short, intense rounds.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

Players spawn on the **Lobby Island**, where they can manage their base, upgrade stats, and enter the Disaster Island through a portal.

On the Disaster Island:

* A random disaster is active each round
* Brainrots spawn across the map with different rarities and modifiers
* Players can carry **one brainrot at a time**
* Carriers move slower and may drop their brainrot when hit or eliminated
* Players must deliver brainrots to **Rescue Zones** to secure them
* When the round ends, saved brainrots are sent to the player’s base

This creates constant risk-versus-reward decisions and competitive chaos between players.

---

## 🌪️ Disasters

Each round features a randomly selected disaster designed to pressure player movement and create unpredictable moments.

Example disasters include:

* Rising lava
* Meteor showers
* Tsunami waves
* Tornado events
* Reverse gravity
* Map hazards and collapsing floors

Disasters rotate every round to keep gameplay fresh and replayable.

## 🧠 Brainrots

Brainrots are collectible creatures that appear during disasters. They come in multiple rarities and may spawn with special modifiers.

### Rarities

* Common
* Rare
* Epic
* Mythic
* Secret (very rare)

### Possible Modifiers

* Golden (bonus rewards)
* Speedy (runs away)
* Frozen (harder to collect)
* Volatile (risky to carry)

Higher rarity brainrots provide better long-term rewards for the player’s base.

## 🚩 Rescue System

Players must deliver brainrots to one of several **Rescue Zones** located around the Disaster Island.

Key rules:

* Only one brainrot can be carried at a time
* Carriers are slowed
* Taking damage may cause the brainrot to drop
* Eliminated players always drop their carried brainrot
* Successfully delivered brainrots are permanently saved

This system encourages movement, player interaction, and high-tension moments.

---

## 🏠 Base Progression

After each round, rescued brainrots are added to the player’s personal base on the Lobby Island.

Brainrots in the base:

* Visually populate the player’s area
* Generate passive rewards over time
* Contribute to long-term progression

Bases have limited capacity, encouraging players to upgrade their base or manage their collection strategically.

---

## 🔁 Round Structure

* Rounds run continuously
* Players can join mid-round
* Each round lasts approximately **60–90 seconds**
* A new disaster and map state begins immediately after each round

This keeps downtime minimal and maintains strong session retention.

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

* Fast, chaotic, and easy to understand
* High replay value through randomness
* Competitive but accessible gameplay
* Strong progression through collection and base growth
* Viral-friendly moments through player interaction and disasters

---

## 🚀 MVP Scope

The initial version focuses on:

* One disaster map
* Multiple brainrot rarities
* Three rescue zones
* Basic base display system
* Core carry and drop mechanics

The game is designed to expand over time with new disasters, modifiers, upgrades, and limited-time events.
